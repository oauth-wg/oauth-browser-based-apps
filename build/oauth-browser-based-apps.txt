1.  Introduction

   This specification describes the current best practices for
   implementing OAuth 2.0 authorization flows in applications executing
   in a browser.

   For native application developers using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect,
   an IETF BCP (best current practice) was published that guides



Parecki & Waite          Expires October 7, 2020                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


   integration of these technologies.  This document is formally known
   as [RFC8252] or BCP 212, but nicknamed "AppAuth" after the OpenID
   Foundation-sponsored set of libraries that assist developers in
   adopting these practices.  [RFC8252] makes specific recommendations
   for how to securely implement OAuth in native applications, including
   incorporating additional OAuth extensions where needed.

   OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps addresses the similarities between
   implementing OAuth for native apps and browser-based apps, and
   includes additional considerations when running in a browser.  This
   is primarily focused on OAuth, except where OpenID Connect provides
   additional considerations.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   In addition to the terms defined in referenced specifications, this
   document uses the following terms:

   "OAuth":  In this document, "OAuth" refers to OAuth 2.0, [RFC6749]
      and [RFC6750].

   "Browser-based application":  An application that is dynamically
      downloaded and executed in a web browser, usually written in
      JavaScript.  Also sometimes referred to as a "single-page
      application", or "SPA".

4.  Overview

   At the time that OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] and [RFC6750] were created,
   browser-based JavaScript applications needed a solution that strictly
   complied with the same-origin policy.  Common deployments of OAuth
   2.0 involved an application running on a different domain than the
   authorization server, so it was historically not possible to use the
   authorization code flow which would require a cross-origin POST
   request.  This was one of the motivations for the definition of the
   implicit flow, which returns the access token in the front channel
   via the fragment part of the URL, bypassing the need for a cross-
   origin POST request.

   However, there are several drawbacks to the implicit flow, generally
   involving vulnerabilities associated with the exposure of the access



Parecki & Waite          Expires October 7, 2020                [Page 3]

   token in the URL.  See Section 9.8 for an analysis of these attacks
   and the drawbacks of using the implicit flow in browsers.  Additional
   attacks and security considerations can be found in
   [oauth-security-topics].

   In recent years, widespread adoption of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
   (CORS), which enables exceptions to the same-origin policy, allows
   browser-based apps to use the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow and
   make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for an access
   token at the token endpoint.  In this flow, the access token is never
   exposed in the less secure front-channel.  Furthermore, adding PKCE
   to the flow ensures that even if an authorization code is
   intercepted, it is unusable by an attacker.

   For this reason, and from other lessons learned, the current best
   practice for browser-based applications is to use the OAuth 2.0
   authorization code flow with PKCE.

   Browser-based applications MUST:

   o  Use the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with the PKCE extension

   o  Protect themselves against CSRF attacks by ensuring the
      authorization server supports PKCE, or by using the OAuth 2.0
      "state" parameter or the OpenID Connect "nonce" parameter to carry
      one-time use CSRF tokens

   o  Register one or more redirect URIs, and use only exact registered
      redirect URIs in authorization requests

   OAuth 2.0 authorization servers MUST:

   o  Require exact matching of registered redirect URIs

   o  Support the PKCE extension

   o  If issuing refresh tokens to browser-based apps, then:

   o  Rotate refresh tokens on each use

   o  Set a maximum lifetime on refresh tokens or expire if they are not
      used in some amount of time

5.  First-Party Applications

   While OAuth was initially created to allow third-party applications
   to access an API on behalf of a user, it has proven to be useful in a
   first-party scenario as well.  First-party apps are applications



Parecki & Waite          Expires October 7, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


   where the same organization provides both the API and the
   application.

   Examples of first-party applications are a web email client provided
   by the operator of the email account, or a mobile banking application
   created by bank itself.  (Note that there is no requirement that the
   application actually be developed by the same company; a mobile
   banking application developed by a contractor that is branded as the
   bank's application is still considered a first-party application.)
   The first-party app consideration is about the user's relationship to
   the application and the service.

   To conform to this best practice, first-party applications using
   OAuth or OpenID Connect MUST use a redirect-based flow (such as the
   OAuth Authorization Code flow) as described later in this document.

   The Resource Owner Password Grant MUST NOT be used, as described in
   [oauth-security-topics] section 3.4.  Instead, by using the
   Authorization Code flow and redirecting the user to the authorization
   server, this provides the authorization server the opportunity to
   prompt the user for multi-factor authentication options, take
   advantage of single-sign-on sessions, or use third-party identity
   providers.  In contrast, the Password grant does not provide any
   built-in mechanism for these, and would instead be extended with
   custom code.

6.  Application Architecture Patterns

   There are three primary architectural patterns available when
   building browser-based applications.

   o  a JavaScript application that has methods of sharing data with
      resource servers, such as using common-domain cookies

   o  a JavaScript application with a backend

   o  a JavaScript application with no backend, accessing resource
      servers directly

   These three architectures have different use cases and
   considerations.

6.1.  Browser-Based Apps that Can Share Data with the Resource Server

   For simple system architectures, such as when the JavaScript
   application is served from a domain that can share cookies with the
   domain of the API (resource server), OAuth adds additional attack
   vectors that could be avoided with a different solution.



Parecki & Waite          Expires October 7, 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


   In particular, using any redirect-based mechanism of obtaining an
   access token enables the redirect-based attacks described in
   [oauth-security-topics], but if the application, authorization server
   and resource server share a domain, then it is unnecessary to use a
   redirect mechanism to communicate between them.

   An additional concern with handling access tokens in a browser is
   that as of the date of this publication, there is no secure storage
   mechanism where JavaScript code can keep the access token to be later
   used in an API request.  Using an OAuth flow results in the
   JavaScript code getting an access token, needing to store it
   somewhere, and then retrieve it to make an API request.

   Instead, a more secure design is to use an HTTP-only cookie between
   the JavaScript application and API so that the JavaScript code can't
   access the cookie value itself.  Additionally, the SameSite cookie
   attribute can be used to prevent CSRF attacks, or alternatively, the
   application and API could be written to use anti-CSRF tokens.

   OAuth was originally created for third-party or federated access to
   APIs, so it may not be the best solution in a common-domain
   deployment.  That said, using OAuth even in a common-domain
   architecture does mean you can more easily rearchitect things later,
   such as if you were to later add a new domain to the system.

6.2.  JavaScript Applications with a Backend

   +-------------+

   In this architecture, the JavaScript code is loaded from a dynamic
   Application Server that also has the ability to execute code itself.
   This enables the ability to keep all of the steps involved in
   obtaining an access token outside of the JavaScript application.

   In this case, the Application Server performs the OAuth flow itself,
   and keeps the access token and refresh token stored internally,
   creating a separate session with the browser-based app via a
   traditional browser cookie.

   (Common examples of this architecture are an Angular front-end with a
   .NET backend, or a React front-end with a Spring Boot backend.)

   The Application Server SHOULD be considered a confidential client,
   and issued its own client secret.  The Application Server SHOULD use
   the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant to initiate a request for an

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


   access token.  Upon handling the redirect from the Authorization
   Server, the Application Server will request an access token using the
   authorization code returned (A), which will be returned to the
   Application Server (B).  The Application Server stores this access
   token itself and establishes its own cookie-based session with the
   Browser application.  The Application Server can store the access
   token either server-side, or in the cookie itself.

   When the JavaScript application in the browser wants to make a
   request to the Resource Server, it MUST instead make the request to
   the Application Server, and the Application Server will make the
   request with the access token to the Resource Server (C), and forward
   the response (D) back to the browser.

   Security of the connection between code running in the browser and
   this Application Server is assumed to utilize browser-level
   protection mechanisms.  Details are out of scope of this document,
   but many recommendations can be found in the OWASP Cheat Sheet series
   (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/), such as setting an HTTP-only
   and Secure cookie to authenticate the session between the browser and
   Application Server.

   In this scenario, the session between the browser and Application
   Server MAY be either a session cookie provided by the Application
   Server, OR the access token itself.  Note that if the access token is
   used as the session identifier, this exposes the access token to the
   end user even if it is not available to the JavaScript application,
   so some authorization servers may wish to limit the capabilities of
   these clients to mitigate risk.

6.3.  JavaScript Applications without a Backend

   +-----------------+         +-------------------------------+

   In this architecture, the JavaScript code is first loaded from a
   static web host into the browser (A), and the application then runs
   in the browser.  This application is considered a public client,
   since there is no way to issue it a client secret and there is no
   other secure client authentication mechanism available in the
   browser.

   The code in the browser initiates the authorization code flow with
   the PKCE extension (described in Section 7) (B) above, and obtains an
   access token via a POST request (C).  The JavaScript app is then
   responsible for storing the access token (and optional refresh token)
   securely using appropriate browser APIs.

   When the JavaScript application in the browser wants to make a
   request to the Resource Server, it can include the access token in
   the request (D) and make the request directly.

   In this scenario, the Authorization Server and Resource Server MUST
   support the necessary CORS headers to enable the JavaScript code to
   make this POST request from the domain on which the script is
   executing.  (See Section 9.6 for additional details.)

7.  Authorization Code Flow

   Public browser-based apps that use the authorization code grant type
   described in Section 4.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] MUST also follow
   these additional requirements described in this section.

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


7.1.  Initiating the Authorization Request from a Browser-Based
      Application

   Public browser-based apps MUST implement the Proof Key for Code
   Exchange (PKCE [RFC7636]) extension to OAuth, and authorization
   servers MUST support PKCE for such clients.

   The PKCE extension prevents an attack where the authorization code is
   intercepted and exchanged for an access token by a malicious client,
   by providing the authorization server with a way to verify the same
   client instance that exchanges the authorization code is the same one
   that initiated the flow.

   Browser-based apps MUST prevent CSRF attacks against their redirect
   URI.  This can be accomplished by any of the below:

   o  using PKCE, and confirming that the authorization server supports
      PKCE

   o  if the application is using OpenID Connect, by using the OpenID
      Connect "nonce" parameter

   o  using a unique value for the OAuth 2.0 "state" parameter

   Browser-based apps MUST follow the recommendations in
   [oauth-security-topics] Section 2.1 to protect themselves during
   redirect flows.

7.2.  Handling the Authorization Code Redirect

   Authorization servers MUST require an exact match of a registered
   redirect URI.

8.  Refresh Tokens

   Refresh tokens provide a way for applications to obtain a new access
   token when the initial access token expires.  With public clients,
   the risk of a leaked refresh token is greater than leaked access
   tokens, since an attacker may be able to continue using the stolen
   refresh token to obtain new access tokens potentially without being
   detectable by the authorization server.

   Browser-based applications provide an attacker with several
   opportunities by which a refresh token can be leaked, just as with
   access tokens.  As such, these applications are considered a higher
   risk for handling refresh tokens.

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


   Authorization servers may choose whether or not to issue refresh
   tokens to browser-based applications. [oauth-security-topics]
   describes some additional requirements around refresh tokens on top
   of the recommendations of [RFC6749].  Applications and authorization
   servers conforming to this BCP MUST also follow the recommendations
   in [oauth-security-topics] around refresh tokens if refresh tokens
   are issued to browser-based apps.

   In particular, authorization servers:

   o  MUST rotate refresh tokens on each use, in order to be able to
      detect a stolen refresh token if one is replayed (described in
      [oauth-security-topics] section 4.12)

   o  MUST either set a maximum lifetime on refresh tokens OR expire if
      the refresh token has not been used within some amount of time

   o  upon issuing a rotated refresh token, MUST NOT extend the lifetime
      of the new refresh token beyond the lifetime of the initial
      refresh token if the refresh token has a preestablished expiration
      time

   For example:

   o  A user authorizes an application, issuing an access token that
      lasts 1 hour, and a refresh token that lasts 24 hours

   o  After 1 hour, the initial access token expires, so the application
      uses the refresh token to get a new access token

   o  The authorization server returns a new access token that lasts 1
      hour, and a new refresh token that lasts 23 hours

   o  This continues until 24 hours pass from the initial authorization

   o  At this point, when the application attempts to use the refresh
      token after 24 hours, the request will fail and the application
      will have to involve the user in a new authorization request

   By limiting the overall refresh token lifetime to the lifetime of the
   initial refresh token, this ensures a stolen refresh token cannot be
   used indefinitely.

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


9.1.  Registration of Browser-Based Apps

   Browser-based applications are considered public clients as defined
   by section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], and MUST be registered with
   the authorization server as such.  Authorization servers MUST record
   the client type in the client registration details in order to
   identify and process requests accordingly.

   Authorization servers MUST require that browser-based applications
   register one or more redirect URIs.

9.2.  Client Authentication

   Since a browser-based application's source code is delivered to the
   end-user's browser, it cannot contain provisioned secrets.  As such,
   a browser-based app with native OAuth support is considered a public
   client as defined by Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749].

   Secrets that are statically included as part of an app distributed to
   multiple users should not be treated as confidential secrets, as one
   user may inspect their copy and learn the shared secret.  For this
   reason, and those stated in Section 5.3.1 of [RFC6819], it is NOT
   RECOMMENDED for authorization servers to require client
   authentication of browser-based applications using a shared secret,
   as this serves little value beyond client identification which is
   already provided by the client_id request parameter.

   Authorization servers that still require a statically included shared
   secret for SPA clients MUST treat the client as a public client, and
   not accept the secret as proof of the client's identity.  Without
   additional measures, such clients are subject to client impersonation
   (see Section 9.3 below).

9.3.  Client Impersonation

   As stated in Section 10.2 of OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749], the authorization
   server SHOULD NOT process authorization requests automatically
   without user consent or interaction, except when the identity of the
   client can be assured.

   If authorization servers restrict redirect URIs to a fixed set of
   absolute HTTPS URIs, preventing the use of wildcard domains, wildcard
   paths, or wildcard query string components, this exact match of
   registered absolute HTTPS URIs MAY be accepted by authorization
   servers as proof of identity of the client for the purpose of
   deciding whether to automatically process an authorization request
   when a previous request for the client_id has already been approved.

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


9.4.  Cross-Site Request Forgery Protections

   Clients MUST prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
   against their redirect URI.  Clients can accomplish this by either
   ensuring the authorization server supports PKCE and relying on the
   CSRF protection that PKCE provides, or if the client is also an
   OpenID Connect client, using the OpenID Connect "nonce" parameter, or
   by using the "state" parameter to carry one-time-use CSRF tokens as
   described in Section 7.1.

   See Section 2.1 of [oauth-security-topics] for additional details.

9.5.  Authorization Server Mix-Up Mitigation

   The security considerations around the authorization server mix-up
   that are referenced in Section 8.10 of [RFC8252] also apply to
   browser-based apps.

   Clients MUST use a unique redirect URI for each authorization server
   used by the application.  The client MUST store the redirect URI
   along with the session data (e.g. along with "state") and MUST verify
   that the URI on which the authorization response was received exactly
   matches.

9.6.  Cross-Domain Requests

   To complete the authorization code flow, the browser-based
   application will need to exchange the authorization code for an
   access token at the token endpoint.  If the authorization server
   provides additional endpoints to the application, such as metadata
   URLs, dynamic client registration, revocation, introspection,
   discovery or user info endpoints, these endpoints may also be
   accessed by the browser-based app.  Since these requests will be made
   from a browser, authorization servers MUST support the necessary CORS
   headers (defined in [Fetch]) to allow the browser to make the
   request.

   This specification does not include guidelines for deciding whether a
   CORS policy for the token endpoint should be a wildcard origin or
   more restrictive.  Note, however, that the browser will attempt to
   GET or POST to the API endpoint before knowing any CORS policy; it
   simply hides the succeeding or failing result from JavaScript if the
   policy does not allow sharing.

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


9.7.  Content-Security Policy

   A browser-based application that wishes to use either long-lived
   refresh tokens or privileged scopes SHOULD restrict its JavaScript
   execution to a set of statically hosted scripts via a Content
   Security Policy ([CSP2]) or similar mechanism.  A strong Content
   Security Policy can limit the potential attack vectors for malicious
   JavaScript to be executed on the page.

9.8.  OAuth Implicit Flow

   The OAuth 2.0 Implicit flow (defined in Section 4.2 of OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749]) works by receiving an access token in the HTTP redirect
   (front-channel) immediately without the code exchange step.  In this
   case, the access token is returned in the fragment part of the
   redirect URI, providing an attacker with several opportunities to
   intercept and steal the access token.

9.8.1.  Attacks on the Implicit Flow

   Many attacks on the implicit flow described by [RFC6819] and
   [oauth-security-topics] do not have sufficient mitigation strategies.
   The following sections describe the specific attacks that cannot be
   mitigated while continuing to use the implicit flow.

9.8.1.1.  Threat: Interception of the Redirect URI

   If an attacker is able to cause the authorization response to be sent
   to a URI under their control, they will directly get access to the
   authorization response including the access token.  Several methods
   of performing this attack are described in detail in
   [oauth-security-topics].

9.8.1.2.  Threat: Access Token Leak in Browser History

   An attacker could obtain the access token from the browser's history.
   The countermeasures recommended by [RFC6819] are limited to using
   short expiration times for tokens, and indicating that browsers
   should not cache the response.  Neither of these fully prevent this
   attack, they only reduce the potential damage.

   Additionally, many browsers now also sync browser history to cloud
   services and to multiple devices, providing an even wider attack
   surface to extract access tokens out of the URL.

   This is discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.2 of
   [oauth-security-topics].

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


9.8.1.3.  Threat: Manipulation of Scripts

   An attacker could modify the page or inject scripts into the browser
   through various means, including when the browser's HTTPS connection
   is being man-in-the-middled by, for example, a corporate network.
   While this type of attack is typically out of scope of basic security
   recommendations to prevent, in the case of browser-based apps it is
   much easier to perform this kind of attack, where an injected script
   can suddenly have access to everything on the page.

   The risk of a malicious script running on the page may be amplified
   when the application uses a known standard way of obtaining access
   tokens, namely that the attacker can always look at the
   "window.location" variable to find an access token.  This threat
   profile is different from an attacker specifically targeting an
   individual application by knowing where or how an access token
   obtained via the authorization code flow may end up being stored.

9.8.1.4.  Threat: Access Token Leak to Third Party Scripts

   It is relatively common to use third-party scripts in browser-based
   apps, such as analytics tools, crash reporting, and even things like
   a Facebook or Twitter "like" button.  In these situations, the author
   of the application may not be able to be fully aware of the entirety
   of the code running in the application.  When an access token is
   returned in the fragment, it is visible to any third-party scripts on
   the page.

9.8.2.  Countermeasures

   In addition to the countermeasures described by [RFC6819] and
   [oauth-security-topics], using the authorization code with PKCE
   extension prevents the attacks described above by avoiding returning
   the access token in the redirect response at all.

   When PKCE is used, if an authorization code is stolen in transport,
   the attacker is unable to do anything with the authorization code.

9.8.3.  Disadvantages of the Implicit Flow

   There are several additional reasons the Implicit flow is
   disadvantageous compared to using the standard Authorization Code
   flow.

   o  OAuth 2.0 provides no mechanism for a client to verify that a
      particular access token was intended for that client, which could
      lead to misuse and possible impersonation attacks if a malicious

Internet-Draft      OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps          April 2020


      party hands off an access token it retrieved through some other
      means to the client.

   o  Returning an access token in the front-channel redirect gives the
      authorization server no assurance that the access token will
      actually end up at the application, since there are many ways this
      redirect may fail or be intercepted.

   o  Supporting the implicit flow requires additional code, more upkeep
      and understanding of the related security considerations, while
      limiting the authorization server to just the authorization code
      flow reduces the attack surface of the implementation.

   o  If the JavaScript application gets wrapped into a native app, then
      [RFC8252] also requires the use of the authorization code flow
      with PKCE anyway.

   In OpenID Connect, the id_token is sent in a known format (as a JWT),
   and digitally signed.  Returning an id_token using the Implicit flow
   (response_type=id_token) requires the client validate the JWT
   signature, as malicious parties could otherwise craft and supply
   fraudulent id_tokens.  Performing OpenID Connect using the
   authorization code flow provides the benefit of the client not
   needing to verify the JWT signature, as the ID token will have been
   fetched over an HTTPS connection directly from the authorization
   server.  Additionally, in many cases an application will request both
   an ID token and an access token, so it is simplier and provides fewer
   attack vectors to obtain both via the authorization code flow.

9.8.4.  Historic Note

   Historically, the Implicit flow provided an advantage to single-page
   apps since JavaScript could always arbitrarily read and manipulate
   the fragment portion of the URL without triggering a page reload.
   This was necessary in order to remove the access token from the URL
   after it was obtained by the app.

   Modern browsers now have the Session History API (described in
   "Session history and navigation" of [HTML]), which provides a
   mechanism to modify the path and query string component of the URL
   without triggering a page reload.  This means modern browser-based
   apps can use the unmodified OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, since
   they have the ability to remove the authorization code from the query
   string without triggering a page reload thanks to the Session History
   API.

Appendix A.  Server Support Checklist

   OAuth authorization servers that support browser-based apps MUST:

   1.  Require "https" scheme redirect URIs.

   2.  Require exact matching of registered redirect URIs.

   3.  Support PKCE [RFC7636].  Required to protect authorization code
       grants sent to public clients.  See Section 7.1

   4.  Support cross-domain requests at the token endpoint in order to
       allow browsers to make the authorization code exchange request.
       See Section 9.6

   5.  Not assume that browser-based clients can keep a secret, and
       SHOULD NOT issue secrets to applications of this type.

   6.  Not support the Resource Owner Password grant for browser-based
       clients.

   7.  Follow the [oauth-security-topics] recommendations on refresh
       tokens, as well as the additional requirements described in
       Section 8.
